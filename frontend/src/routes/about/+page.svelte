            <h2>HISTORY</h2>

            <p>
                The history of Odyssey was founded by Samuel Batchelor,
                as an accumulation of his child-hood passion for astronomy and love for all things tech-related. Whilst studying full-time at the Bachelor of Information Technology at Otago Polytechnic, he sought a golden opportunity to further fufil his interest in astronomy. The golden opportunity was to build a website devoted entirely to space, and a platform where users can easily find out about our solar system and outer space.
